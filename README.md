# Destiny
A card game in which destiny determines the end result. This program can be used to simulate thousands of games in a few seconds, while playing one game by hand may take up multiple hours.

## Runs
Running 1000 simulated games (using one deck of cards) gives us an average of about 350 rounds, with a minimum of 46 and a maximum of 2243, these results are about the same when this experiment is repeated.

## Tests
```
python -m unittest discover -s test
```
